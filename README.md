# RealTime camera
This app lets you stream your phone's camera in HD, to any device on any platform having browser support, and that too in realtime!

## Aim
The aim of this application is to capture pictures remotely. In other words, be a full fledged remote camera. It can also be used as a surveillance camera if needed.

## Progress
Currently, the project is at the base. I have moved from using libx264 to M-JPEG, and it has improved performance by a lot. Still, there is lot to be done and bugs to be fixed.

## How to report an issue/make a change
Go to [Issues tab](https://github.com/InfernoCoder/realtime-camera/issues "Issues"), and create an Issue there. I will resolve it, _but I cannot give any fixed dates for resolving an issue. I got to school too, and there I have exams too, so I am kind of busy. **But I will try my best to resolve them**_.

To make a change, fork this project, clone it, make changes, create a commit and push, and create a pull request. I will be happy if you make pull requests :).

## Base project and third-party libraries
- OpenCL sources and libraries from Khronos and my Qualcomm device.
